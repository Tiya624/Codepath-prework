### App Idea

**MindBloom - A Mental Health Companion**

MindBloom is a simple yet powerful app aimed at supporting users' mental wellness through mood tracking, journaling prompts, and daily positive affirmations. The app would allow users to select their current mood, receive journaling prompts tailored to that mood, and store their reflections. Over time, users can view visual summaries of their mental health trends. Features Iâ€™d like to implement include mood analytics, custom prompts, and encouraging quotes or videos that change daily. Optionally, it could integrate calming music or breathing exercises.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge while building the app was getting the screen color to update dynamically on each button tap. Once I figured out how to generate and apply random colors in Swift, the rest of the implementation was smooth.
